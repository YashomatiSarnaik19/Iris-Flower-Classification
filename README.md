# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project is implementation of Support Vector Machine which is a supervised machine learning algorithm that analyses data for classification and regression. <br>
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
